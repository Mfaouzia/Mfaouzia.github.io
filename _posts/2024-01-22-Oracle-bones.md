Have you ever seen something that changed your perspective on life? Something that made you appreciate the beauty and complexity of another culture? Something that sparked your curiosity and inspired you to learn more? 

That’s what happened to me when I saw oracle bones for the first time.

**Oracle bones** are pieces of animal bone or turtle shell that were used for divination in **ancient China**. They are the earliest written records of Chinese civilization, and they contain fascinating insights into the history, culture, and language of the Shang dynasty.

In this post, I’m going to share with you my personal story of discovering oracle bones, and how they made me fall in love with Chinese history. I’ll also show you some examples of oracle bones, explain what they mean, and tell you how you can see them for yourself.

## Overview of Oracle Bones

**Oracle bones** date back to the second millennium BCE, during the **Shang dynasty**, which ruled over the Yellow River valley. The Shang kings and priests used oracle bones to communicate with their ancestors and gods, and to seek guidance on important matters such as war, agriculture, weather, and rituals.

To perform divination, they would carve questions on the bones, then apply heat to them until they cracked. The cracks were then interpreted as the answers from the spirits. The answers were also recorded on the bones, along with the date and the outcome of the events.

Oracle bones are the oldest form of Chinese writing, and they reveal a lot about the Shang society, culture, and religion. They also provide valuable information on the development of Chinese characters, as many of the symbols on the bones are similar to the modern ones.

Oracle bones were discovered by accident in the late 19th century, when local farmers in Anyang, Henan province, found them while digging for fertilizer. They sold them as “dragon bones” to traditional medicine dealers, who ground them into powder for medicinal purposes. It was not until 1899, when a scholar named Wang Yirong noticed the inscriptions on the bones, that their true value was recognized.

Since then, thousands of oracle bones have been unearthed, and many of them are now displayed in museums around the world. They are considered a national treasure and a cultural heritage of China.

## Example of Oracle Bones
Here is a picture of an oracle bone that I saw at the Chinese Character Museum in Anyang, where I had the chance to visit during *the 2023 China (Anyang) International Conference of Chinese Characters*. It was part of the conference program, and it was one of the highlights of my trip.

This oracle bone is a turtle plastron, which is the underside of the turtle shell. It has several inscriptions on it, which are the questions and answers of the divination. The questions are written in vertical columns, from right to left, and the answers are written in smaller characters below or above the cracks.

According to the museum guide, this oracle bone was used to ask about the harvest of millet, a type of grain that was a staple food for the Shang people. The questions are:

1. Will there be a good harvest of millet this year?
2. Will there be a good harvest of millet next year?
3. Will there be a good harvest of millet in three years?

The answers are:

1. There will be a good harvest of millet this year.
2. There will be a good harvest of millet next year.
3. There will not be a good harvest of millet in three years.

The guide also explained that the oracle bone was dated to the reign of *King Wu Ding*, who was one of the most powerful and influential rulers of the Shang dynasty. He was known for his military conquests, his religious devotion, and his support of female officials. His reign lasted for about 59 years, from 1250 to 1192 BCE.

I was amazed by the oracle bone, and how it showed the connection between the *ancient* and the *modern* Chinese writing. I could recognize some of the characters, such as **“China”**, and how they evolved from the pictographic symbols on the bone. I also learned some interesting facts about the Shang dynasty, such as their agricultural practices, their calendar system, and their political structure.

## What’s Marked Me
* Seeing the oracle bone was a life-changing experience for me. It made me realize how rich and profound Chinese history and culture are, and how much I still have to learn. It also made me appreciate the beauty and logic of Chinese writing, and how it reflects the wisdom and creativity of the ancient Chinese people.
  * As a *Sinophile*, I have always been interested in Chinese culture, but seeing the oracle bone made me fall in love with Chinese history. I wanted to know more about the Shang dynasty, and how they influenced the later dynasties. I wanted to know more about the oracle bones, and how they were used and interpreted. I wanted to know more about the Chinese characters, and how they developed and changed over time.
  * As an *international student*, I have always been challenged by Chinese writing, but seeing the oracle bone made me motivated to learn Chinese characters. I realized that Chinese writing is not just a random collection of strokes, but a system of symbols that have meaning and history. I realized that learning Chinese characters is not just a matter of memorization, but a process of discovery and understanding. 
* Seeing the oracle bone was a turning point for me. It inspired me to pursue my passion for Chinese history and culture, and to improve my skills in Chinese writing. It also made me grateful for the opportunity to visit China, and to experience its wonders and wonders.

## Oracles of China

**Chinese oracle bones**, produced during the *Shang Dynasty*, reflect a fascinating era in history. The king ruled supreme, China was a slave society, productivity was low, and divination/superstition was a key method for the king to make policy decisions. Oracle bones were the main medium for divination. At that time, the two most important affairs for the state were **war** and **sacrifice**, which both relied on oracle bones. Therefore, today, China can learn about the entire Shang culture through the writing on the oracle bones, which is the “messenger” of the Chinese slave society.

## The Art of Awe: Words That Inspired My Schoolmates
I was not the only one who was inspired by the oracle bones and Chinese history. Many of my friends who joined me on the trip were also amazed and moved by what they saw and learned. Here are some of the words that they shared with me:

* "If There Were No Oracle Bones

If there were no oracle bones, Chinese civilization would lose its origin. The long river of history is silent, who can speak of the mystery of writing?

The remnants of the Yin-Shang dynasty are passed down through the ages, turtle shells and animal bones preserve the fragments. Pictographs and ideographs convey profound meanings, cultural treasures are forever transmitted.
  
Now Chinese characters are known to the world, how can we forget the source of our water? Cherish the heritage and inherit the aspiration, the descendants and future generations will enjoy the blessings." - Maia from Hebi City, Henan Province.

* "The Anyang Museum was the first place where I saw Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. I felt like I had traveled back to the ancient times of the Shang and Zhou dynasties, and witnessed the glory of Chinese civilization through the countless relics. I think that oracle bones are not only a vital part of Chinese culture, but also have some impact on modern society, academia and culture. Through oracle bones, I can not only learn more about Chinese culture and the history of Chinese characters, but also discover a new way of communication." - Ratana Kim from Cambodia.
