  My name is **Hishma**, and I have been in China for almost **five years** now. I do not consider myself an expert in knowing the best way to live somewhere. In fact, I arrived in China when I had just turned eighteen, and before that, I was living in the comfort of my parents' house. So I moved thousands of kilometers from anything I was familiar with in the pursuit of higher education. All these years, I have been learning how to cope with everything; I am still learning. It is scary, but I have been well-guided, and my tendency to follow rules, similar to Hermione Granger, might have contributed to that.

  So here is what I can say to anyone who might be interested in coming to China. I have not included information about the admission or scholarship application process because I think it can vary depending on where you are.

## 1. Accommodation and Allowance
  Each university has its own rules regarding **accommodation**. If you are enrolled, you must follow their regulations. It is not uncommon for universities to require their students to live in the campus dormitory for at least a year. The accommodation options vary from one school to another, offering single rooms, double rooms, rooms for three people, or more. Most universities do not allow cooking in the rooms, and some might provide a common kitchen. For more details, you should inquire about the school's policies during your application process.

  If you choose to rent something outside of your campus, it is at your discretion, and fortunately, many universities do not restrict you from doing so. I would advise you to have a friend who lives off-campus guide you to avoid being deceived and to help you find your dream rental apartment.

  When it comes to money, be aware of the exchange rate, be financially responsible, and save some for emergencies. How much you can spend in a month depends entirely on your lifestyle. **A reminder that, according to the law, a foreigner on a study visa cannot work. If you work without a permit, you risk having your residence permit canceled and being expelled.**

  Recently, a work-study visa has been implemented, which allows you to work. However, I do not have many details about it. From what I have heard, it is not easy to obtain, but it is not impossible.

## 2. Must-haves on Your Phone
  **It is 2024; you must know that applications such as Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok, and Google Maps do not work normally in China without the use of a VPN**. And even some VPNs do not work. Before your trip, make sure to download **WeChat**, which, in my opinion, is the most useful phone application in China, especially if you plan on staying for a long period of time. Having a translator that works without a VPN will be very helpful to communicate or just understand what is on the menu. Personally, I use **Baidu Translate**, and it is very convenient; you could give it a try. **Alipay** is another useful application used for paying, just like WeChat. To my knowledge, you will need a **local phone number** and a **Chinese bank account** to be able to use **the payment function**. After you have settled, install TaoBao, an online shopping application (fully in Chinese, so you must know a bit of the language to enjoy using it!). You can find what you want at a relatively cheap price. Beware of being scammed as it is fairly common.

## 3. Learning Mandarin is for your best
  You are set to study in China. Have you prepared yourself to learn Mandarin? Maybe you already know some basics; find someone to practice with. It can be a foreigner who has been there for quite some time or a local; some locals around you would be glad to discuss with you. Do not be too shy to talk to them. The most common things they will tell you are: **"‰Ω†ÊòØÂì™ÈáåÁöÑ?" (Where are you from?), "‰Ω†Â§öÂ§ßÂëÄ?" (How old are you?), "ÂìáÔºÅ‰Ω†‰∏≠ÊñáËØ¥ÂæóËøô‰πàÂ•Ω!" (Wow! Your Chinese is so good!) or its variant "ÂìáÔºÅ‰Ω†ÊôÆÈÄöËØùËØ¥ÂæóÂæàÊ†áÂáÜ" (Wow! You speak very standard Mandarin!)**.

  If you do not know anything, do not be too nervous; many have been where you are now. You have to know that the first few weeks will be tough, but you should not give up easily. Ask those around you for tips to learn faster and more efficiently. When you find what suits you best, you will improve rapidly.

  I recommend you download **Hanping** and **Pleco**, two free Chinese-English dictionaries that can easily assist you in your basic learning of the language. I still use them to this day.

**N.B. You should know that the Chinese Proficiency Test, aka HSK, certificate has a validity of two years. Usually, after it expires, you cannot use it to apply for anything. But some places might have different regulations; when in doubt, you must ask.**

## 4. "The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page." ‚Äì St. Augustine
  Let me ask you, with a population of over 1.4 billion living in a 9.6 million km¬≤ land, can you realistically expect them to treat you the exact same way?

  You have to understand that some Chinese have never met a foreigner in their life or may have encountered very few. And they are living in such a huge country that they do not need to go abroad to discover stunning scenery; they have it all. In fact, many do not possess a passport. **What I am trying to say here is that, during your stay in China, you will meet very open-minded, friendly people with whom you can bond instantly. On the other hand, you will also encounter the rudest, narrow-minded, xenophobic, borderline racist people you have ever met**. For my part, I think most Chinese belong somewhere in the middle. They are friendly but can appear aloof, they are genuine with you, but they just do not know if a conversation with you is possible. **Believe me when I say that as soon as they realize you can speak Chinese, they will start asking you many questions and want to discuss with you. They might ask you quite personal questions, and most of the time, it is not to harm or criticize you**.

  Therefore, while you are in China, **try your best to keep a positive attitude toward life**. Go and learn about their history, their culture, and try to understand their beliefs. You need to be ready to be mind-blown by how deep and rich Chinese culture is. By learning about them, you open doors of opportunities for them to learn about your own culture. That way, we can all grow together.

## 5. "Everything you will say can and will be used against you."
  Does that sound familiar? Well, I can only urge you to be careful about what you say, **what you send (text messages, audios, short videos), and to whom because you could be held accountable for them**. Even worse, someone around you could be held accountable for what you did.

  When you first arrive, you will quickly notice how often your teachers emphasize abiding by the laws and regulations of China. And frankly, you should not try to go against them, especially in the first few months of your stay, including taboo topics. **Each country has its own political system, and as a foreigner, you should not discuss it much anywhere**.

  I am not telling you to live on eggshells; **life is short, and we should be free to live it happily**. I am just giving you this advice based on my own experiences. You might mean no harm by saying a particular thing, but because the other party misunderstood you, they accused you of being mean or suggesting worse. Please remember this quote; maybe someday, it will be useful to you.

  **In a foreign land, we should always have a minimum respect for everyone, learn the basic local etiquette, be mindful of our actions, and as a student, keep working hard. Quickly, you will find what works for you, and things always get better.**
