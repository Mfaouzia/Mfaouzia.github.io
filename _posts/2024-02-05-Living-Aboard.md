Moving to a new country can be an *exciting adventure*, but it can also feel like a *daunting challenge*. You may face some difficulties, such as language barriers, unfamiliar customs, and homesickness.. However, you can also discover new opportunities like learning, meeting new people, and trying different things. How can you make the best of your life abroad and enjoy the advantages of living in a different culture? This article will provide¬†eleven practical tips to not only help you adjust but flourish in your new cultural setting. Whether you‚Äôre preparing for a big move or already living abroad, these tips will help you make your journey more enjoyable and rewarding.

## Tip 1: Learn the Language
One of the best ways to immerse yourself  in a new culture is by learning the **language**. Language is not only a means of communication but also a gateway into understanding the people's culture, values, and thoughts. Learning the language will help you communicate with locals, making friends, and understanding the subtleties of the culture. 
For instance, you can learn basic greetings, expressions of gratitude, asking for directions, ordering food, or make small talk. You can also enjoy the local media, such as newspapers, magazines, TV shows, movies, or music. You do not have to be perfect, but making an effort to learn some essential words and sentences, like *‚Äúhello‚Äù*, *‚Äúthank you‚Äù*, *‚Äúhow are you‚Äù*, and *‚Äúwhere is the bathroom‚Äù*. You can use online tools, apps, books, or attend classes to learn the language. Alternatively, practicing with native speakers, either in person or online, can be immensely helpful. 

Here are some resources that I recommend:
- [Duolingo](https://www.englishtest.duolingo.com/): A free and enjoyable  app that teaches  the basics of any language in just 10 minutes a day.
- [Babbel](https://www.babbel.com/): A paid and professional app that helps you improve your vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation in any language.
- [Lingoda](https://www.lingoda.com/en/): An online platform that connects you with native teachers who provide personalized and interactive lessons in any language.
- [Italki](https://www.italki.com/): A community of language learners and teachers who can assist you in practicing your speaking skills in any language.
  
## Tip 2: Be Open-minded and Curious
Another key to flourishing in a new culture is to approach it with an **open-mind** and **curiosity**. Instead of judging or avoiding differences, try to accept and explore them. Show respect and patience towards the customs, traditions, beliefs, and actions of the new culture, even if they seem strange or unfamiliar at first. Ask questions, listen attentively, observe,, and learn from the people around you. This openness will lead you to new perspectives, knowledge, and experience that will enrich your life and broaden your horizons.

For example, when you are living in a new country, there are various ways to immerse yourself in the culture. You can learn how to cook a local dish, play a local instrument, or participate in a local festival. Additionally, you can acquire new skill, like yoga, martial arts, or pottery. Engaging in new experiences such as hiking, camping, or volunteering is also an option. 

Here are some tips on how to be more open-minded and curious:
- Read books or articles about the history, culture, or society of your new country.
- Watch documentaries or movies that showcase the reality, diversity, or beauty of your new country.
- Join clubs or groups that align your interests, or introduce you to new hobbies.
- Take courses or workshops that teach you something new or challenge you to grow.
  
## Tip 3: Find a Balance Between the Old and the New
Living abroad doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to lose or change your own culture. Instead, look for a **balance between the old** and **the new**, by keeping some of your habits, values, and tastes, while also adopting some from the new culture. A fusion of elements from both cultures can lead to the creation of a unique style. For instance, you can celebrate both your own and the local holidays, enjoy both your own and the local food, and listen to music from both cultures. Finding a balance will make you feel more comfortable and confident in your new place, while also respecting and enjoying the diversity of cultures.
      
## Tip 4: Make Friends with the Locals
A good strategy for adapting to a new culture is to **make friends with the locals**. They can assist you navigating the new environment, educate you about the culture, and provide support when you feel lonely or homesick. Moreover, they can  introduce you to new places, activities, and people that you might not stumble upon alone.. Building relationships with the locals will help you feel more welcomed and connected in your new home.

**Personal Story**: 
I have made many friends with the locals since I moved to China. The first time I visited to China was in 2017, when I was in high school. I was amazed by the country‚Äôs diversity and beauty, and wanted to learn more about it. The second time was in March 2019, when I came to study at Dalian University. During that time, I would often go to the university park or library and try to make friends with Chinese students. I understand that making the first move can be challenging as we tend to overthink what others will think of us. But for me, making friends comes naturally, because I can talk to anyone. 

So, how do I do it? First, I analyze the person in front of me. For instance, if I‚Äôm at the university park and see a young person, I assume that they are a student. I say hello and ask something like, ‚ÄúDo you know any market on  campus? I‚Äôm new here..‚Äù Usually, the person ends up helping me, because I‚Äôm new, and they are local. Along the way, I ask them questions about their major, or which province they are from. As I have knowledge about China‚Äôs culture, we can engage in a conversation. To give an example,, I once met a girl from Sichuan and asked her if she liked spicy food. She answered yes, and  invited me to try some hot pot with her. We had a fantastic time, and we became good friends. It‚Äôs the same approach if I meet people outside of campus.. 

Let me provide another example. When I moved to Tianjin, I lived outside the campus and met many people who became like family to me. In January 2022, when the COVID-19 outbreak started near my neighborhood, I went to my community office and offered help. It was there that I met a kind-hearted sister. After a few days, she invited me to her home and introduced me to her husband and child, saying.‚ÄòYou are like a sister to me, and I want you to meet my family.‚Äô Touched by her kindness, I gladly accepted the invitation. And last year, she took me to her village, where I met her entire family , including siblings, nieces, nephews, neighbors, and friends. They welcomed me with open arms, and treated me as one of their own. They showed me their farm, cooked delicious food for me, and taught me local songs and dances. Over time, we've grown close.. I‚Äôve learned so much about  Chinese culture, language, and lifestyle from them, and they've had the opportunity to learn about my culture, religion, and values. Our relationship is built on  mutual respect and appreciation.

## Tip 5: Keep in Touch with Your Family and Friends
Living abroad **doesn‚Äôt mean that you have to cut off contact with your family and friends**. You can keep in touch with them through phone calls, video chats, emails, or social media. You can share your experiences, feelings, and thoughts with them, and listen to theirs. You can also send them gifts, cards, or photos to show them that you care. Keeping in touch with your family and friends will help you feel less isolated and more loved in your new country.

**Personal Story:**
I want to emphasize this point, because I have some regrets that I wish I could avoid. I do not usually like to share my feelings, but in this case, I have no choice. This article is meant to provide tips, so I believe it is important to be honest with you. 
Let me start by saying that the love of my life was and is my **DAD** (may his soul rest in peace). He was the person I could share anything without fear. He was my first teacher in life, teaching me how to read, write, and speak. He also taught me the values of kindness, respect, and bravery. He was always there for me, supporting, encouraging, and loving me. However, when I left the country, it became difficult to communicate with him. He had WhatsApp, but struggled to use it. He didn‚Äôt know how to send messages, photos, or voice notes. He only knew how to answer normal calls. So, I would call him once a month, recharging credit and calling him normally. He was always happy to hear from me, asking about my life, studies, and health., While, also sharing about his own life and health. He always ended the call with ‚Äú Take care of yourself.‚Äù When he passed away in July 2022, I felt the most regret. Why didn‚Äôt I try to find a way to call him every week? Why didn‚Äôt I try to teach him how to use WhatsApp better? Why didn‚Äôt I express how much I loved and missed him? To be honest, I miss him every single day. I wish I could hear his voice, see his face, and hug him once again. Since that day, I  make it a point to call my mom at least twice a day, and my brother once a week, knowing that he is focused on his studies and only opens social media on weekends.

My phone broke and I purchased a new one, changing my SIM card. I decided to add my friends later, as I wanted to prioritize my family. However, due to being occupied I forgot and got accustomed to only calling my family. Then in December 2023, one day as I opened my Facebook,  I discovered a message informing me that one of my good friends had passed away. She was my childhood friend, and we grew up together. playing, studying, and dreaming together. She was like a sister to me, and I cared deeply for her. I was left speechless. I felt remorseful, because it had been a year since we last spoke. I didn‚Äôt know what had happened to her, or how she had died. I felt guilty and sad, because I had not kept in touch with her, or inquired about her well-being. However, this incident has taught me the importance of taking care of the few friends I have left. They are dear to me, and I value their presence in my life. I may not be able to call them every day, due to everyone‚Äôs busy schedules, but I should make it a point to send a text at least once a week. I should ask them how they are, what they are doing, and if they need any support. 

## Tip 6: Explore Your New Surroundings
A good strategy to enjoy living in a new culture is to **explore your new surroundings**. You can visit the local attractions, such as museums, parks, monuments, or markets. You can also travel to nearby cities, towns, or countries, and see the different landscapes, architectures, and cultures. You can also try new things, such as sports, hobbies, or foods, that you might not have access to in your home country. Exploring your new surroundings will help you appreciate the beauty and diversity of your new country, and make your life abroad more fun and exciting.

**Personal Story**: 
I know this tip might seem hard for some people, because of the language barrier or the fear of rejection. I can understand that, but you do not have to visit the whole country in one day. Some people, like me, who are ‚Äúambiverts‚Äù or ‚Äúintroverts,‚Äù might not feel comfortable doing this. But I can tell you that it‚Äôs worth it. When I went to Dalian City for studying, I used to go to the university park to meet new friends. I used to ask them what  the interesting places in Dalian  City, were and then I went to visit them by myself. Was it difficult? YES, I got lost many times, haha, but it‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôm proud of myself now. After two months, I knew the map like a pro. I remember one time, I wanted to go to  Tiger Beach, a famous scenic spot in Dalian. I took a bus, but I got off at the wrong stop. I asked a passerby for directions using my broken Chinese, but he didn‚Äôt understand me. I felt frustrated and helpless. But then, I saw a sign that said ‚ÄúTiger Beach‚Äù with an arrow. I followed the sign and walked for about 20 minutes. And then, I saw it. Tiger Beach was beautiful. It had a long sandy beach, a blue sea, and a giant rock that looked like a tiger. I felt a surge of joy and relief. I took some pictures and enjoyed the view. I also met some friendly tourists who spoke English. They invited me to join them for lunch. We had a great time, and we exchanged our contact information. They became my new friends. 

When I moved to Tianjin, I found myself doing  the same thing as I did in my previous city. While I can't claim to know the entire city of Tianjin, I can confidently say that I have visited 80% of its interesting places, as well as 14 other cities across China. Based on my experiences, I would  advise anyone moving to a new city to try and find a local friend first. This way, you can ask them for recommendations on good places to visit.. Trust me, you'll be amazed by what you can discover and learn through local insights...
One example of a memorable visit I had was to the Ancient Culture Street in Tianjin. This street is a renowned tourist attraction, characterized by its long stretch of traditional buildings, shops, and stalls.Walking through it felt like stepping back in time. I was exposed to various unique sights such as paper-cutting, clay figurines, and shadow puppets. Additionally, I indulged in  local snacks, like steamed buns, fried dough sticks, and candied fruits, all of which  were delicious. During my visit, I even had the opportunity to interact with  a local girl who was selling souvenirs. She was very friendly and helpful, sharing stories and legends about the street. To top it all off, she taught me some words and phrases in the Tianjin dialect. Her humor made us fast friends.

## Tip 7: Take Care of Yourself
In terms of advice, I would suggest **taking care of yourself** when adjusting to a new culture. It's normal to experience stress, anxiety, or depression, due to the changes, challenges, or difficulties that come with living abroad. Additionally, factors such as different climates, food, or lifestyles can make you feel tired, sick, or homesick. To mitigate these effects, prioritize your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. This can be achieved by maintaining a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, engaging in regular exercise, and making time for relaxation. Don't hesitate to seek support from friends, family, or professionals whenever you're in need. By prioritizing self-care, you'll be better equipped to feel happy and maintain good health in your new country.

**Personal Story**: 
- Firstly, I want to start with the *‚Äòjet lag disorder‚Äô*, which can happen to anyone who travels across different time zones. It can be very hard to avoid , but it‚Äôs still possible. I have been to China three times (October 2017, March 2019, September 2019. You might ask, is China my dream country? Ha-ha, YES!). But in those three times, I suffered from jet lag, until I learned what to do. When you arrive in your destination country, try not to sleep if it‚Äôs not the normal sleeping time there. Wait until the night and then go to bed. It‚Äôs hard, yes, but we can do it.

- Secondly, try to plan a time that is convenient for you and your friends or family to call each other. You can‚Äôt call them anytime, because maybe when they are free, you are busy, or vice versa. For me, I call my mother at 12 pm Beijing time, which is 7 am in my home country, and 9 pm, which is 4 pm in my home country. This time works well for both of us. I always look forward to hearing her voice, and telling her about my adventures. She always listens to me with interest and encouragement, and tells me about her life and news. We laugh, we cry, we share. She is my best friend, and I love her so much.
  
- Thirdly, for your health (mental and physical), apart from what I mentioned above, Do not forget to walk at least 30 minutes a day, if you can‚Äôt go to the gym. Walking is a great way to exercise, relax, and explore. You can see new things, meet new people, and breathe fresh air. You can also listen to music, podcasts, or audio-books, to keep your mind entertained and informed. Journaling your feelings is also good. It helps you express your emotions, reflect on your experiences, and cope with stress. I have a notebook where I write down my thoughts and feelings every day. Sometimes I write about what I did, what I saw, what I learned, or what I enjoyed. Sometimes I write about what I missed, what I worried about, what I struggled with, or what I wished. Writing helps me clear my mind, understand myself, and appreciate my life.

## Tip 8: Be Positive and Grateful
A great way to thrive in a new culture is by maintaining a **positive** and **grateful mindset**. It's possible that you may face some challenges, frustrations, or disappointments due to cultural differences, misunderstandings, or conflicts while living abroad. You may also experience feelings of sadness, anger, or regret as a result of the sacrifices, losses, or mistakes associated with living abroad. However, it is important to focus on the positive aspects and be grateful for the opportunities, benefits, and joys that come with living in a new country. It is equally important to learn from negative experiences and remain optimistic about the future. By adopting a positive and grateful attitude, you will find yourself feeling more content and hopeful in your new surroundings.

**Personal Story**: 
As mentioned in tip 7, journaling is a helpful way to express emotions and manage stress. One specific type of journaling that I have found to be particularly beneficial is keeping a gratitude journal. This journal serves as a dedicated space where I write down things I am thankful for on a daily basis. You can refer to the image below to see the simple format I use for my gratitude journal. I begin by noting the date, followed by a motivational quote, and then divide the page into two sections: "Day" and "Night." This journal is my personal treasure, through which I communicate with myself. It helps me shift my focus towards the positive aspects of my life, appreciate the small joys, and foster a sense of optimism for the future.

## Tip 9: Be Flexible and Adaptable
One of the best ways to succeed in a new culture is to **be flexible** and **adaptable**. You might face some changes, surprises, or challenges, due to the unpredictability, uncertainty, or complexity of living abroad. For example, you might experience culture shock, which is the feeling of confusion, anxiety, or discomfort that you might feel when you encounter a different culture. You might also need to adjust, compromise, or improvise, due to the differences, expectations, or demands of living abroad. For example, you might need to learn new skills, such as a new language, a new job, or a new hobby. You should be flexible and adaptable to the new situations, conditions, and opportunities that you encounter. You should also be willing to change, learn, and grow, as a result of living abroad. For example, you might find new opportunities, such as making new friends, discovering new places, or pursuing new goals. Being flexible and adaptable will help you feel more prepared and capable in your new country. 

Here are some tips on how to be more flexible and adaptable:
- Be open-minded and curious. Do not judge or resist the differences, but try to accept and explore them. Ask questions, listen, watch, and learn from the people and the environment around you.
- Be resilient and optimistic. Do not let problems, frustrations, or disappointments get you down, but try to overcome and learn from them. Focus on the positive and be grateful for the opportunities, benefits, and joys of living abroad.
- Be creative and resourceful. Do not limit yourself to the familiar or the comfortable, but try to find new ways to do things, solve problems, or have fun. Use the resources and tools that are available to you, or create your own.

## Tip 10: Have Fun and Enjoy Yourself
A helpful tip to love living in a new culture is to **have fun** and **enjoy yourself**. You might have some goals, responsibilities, or obligations, due to the reasons, purposes, or expectations of living abroad. For example, you might have to study, work, or volunteer in your new country. You might also have some worries, fears, or doubts, due to the risks, difficulties, or uncertainties of living abroad. For example, you might worry about your visa, finances, or safety. But you should not let these things stop you from having fun and enjoying yourself. You should make time for yourself, do things that make you happy, and celebrate your achievements. For example, you can find a hobby that you like, such as painting, dancing, or gardening. You can also join events that interest you, such as concerts, festivals, or sports. You can also play games that entertain you, such as board games, video games, or puzzles. You should also have a sense of humor, laugh at yourself, and enjoy the funny moments. For example, you can make jokes about your mistakes, watch comedies, or read comics. Having fun and enjoying yourself will help you feel more relaxed and positive in your new country. 

Here are some tips on how to have fun and enjoy yourself:
- Find a hobby that you like. A hobby is an activity that you do for pleasure, not for work. It can help you relax, express yourself, and learn new skills. You can find a hobby that suits your personality, interests, and abilities. For example, if you are artistic, you can try painting, drawing, or photography. If you are active, you can try dancing, hiking, or cycling. If you are curious, you can try cooking, gardening, or knitting.
- Join events that interest you. An event is an occasion that brings people together for a common purpose, such as entertainment, education, or celebration. It can help you have fun, meet new people, and discover new things. You can join events that match your preferences, goals, and budget. For example, if you like music, you can go to concerts, karaoke, or open mic nights. If you like culture, you can go to museums, theaters, or art galleries. If you like sports, you can go to stadiums, arenas, or parks.
- Play games that entertain you. A game is a form of play that involves rules, goals, and challenges. It can help you have fun, stimulate your brain, and improve your mood. You can play games that fit your taste, mood, and schedule. For example, if you like strategy, you can play chess, checkers, or Sudoku. If you enjoy adventure, you can try escape rooms, scavenger hunts, or role-playing games. If trivia is your thing, you can play quizzes, crosswords, or word games.
  
## Tip 11: Set Limits and Boundaries
An effective technique for living in harmony with a new culture is to **establish limits** and **boundaries**. You might face some situations, temptations, or pressures, due to the differences, influences, or expectations of living abroad. You may also need to make decisions, choices, or compromises, because of the opportunities, challenges, or dilemmas of living abroad. It is important to have limits and boundaries that reflect your values, beliefs, and goals.
For me, as a Muslim and a student. I always communicate my limits and boundaries clearly and politely to others, while also  respecting theirs.. For example, I inform my friends that I do not drink alcohol, but I do not judge them if they choose to do so. I also ask them not to offer me alcohol, but I do not mind if they drink in front of me..Having limits and boundaries will help you stay true to yourself and your faith, while also respecting and appreciating the diversity of cultures. 

Here are some tips on how to set limits and boundaries:
- Be clear and polite. Do not be vague or rude about your limits and boundaries. Clearly and politely explain them to others, while also listening to their limits and boundaries. Do not assume that they know or understand your limits and boundaries, vice versa. If necessary, ask. questions, clarify, and confirm.
- Be consistent and respectful. Do not change or violate your limits and boundaries, or those of others, depending on the situation, mood, or person. Stick to your limits and boundaries, and respect those of others, regardless of the circumstances, feelings, or influences. Do not pressure or persuade others to change or violate their limits and boundaries, and do not allow  others to pressure or persuade you to change or violate yours.
